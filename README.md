# BACS Information Model Namespaces

This repository reserves the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) namespaces used in the manuscript:

"_Combining the Brick Schema and the Control Description Language for Automation and Controls in BIM_"

## Reserved Namespaces

The following URIs are established here to serve as unique, persistent semantic identifiers for the concepts and control libraries described in the work:

- Extensions Schema: https://efjerb.github.io/bacs-ontology/ex#
- Control Library Schema: https://efjerb.github.io/bacs-ontology/ctrlLib#

## Purpose

These namespaces provide stable identifiers for the custom RDF relationships (e.g., ex:connectedTo) and composite control blocks (e.g., ctrlLib:AHUController) proposed in the research. Using a domain controlled by the authors ensures the long-term validity of the semantic identifiers used in the knowledge graph.

_Note: This repository currently serves as a namespace placeholder. The full RDF serialization of the graph is generated dynamically by the workflow tools associated with the publication._
